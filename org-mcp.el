;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for
;; Org-mode, enabling AI assistants and other MCP clients to interact
;; with Org files.

;;; Code:

(require 'mcp-server-lib)
(require 'org)

(defun org-mcp--tool-get-todo-config ()
  "Return the TODO keyword configuration."
  ;; Minimal implementation that returns empty config
  '((sequences . [])
    (todoStates . [])
    (doneStates . [])
    (semantics . [])))

(defun org-mcp-enable ()
  "Enable the org-mcp server."
  (mcp-server-lib-register-tool
   #'org-mcp--tool-get-todo-config
   :id "org-get-todo-config"
   :description "Get TODO keyword configuration for task states"
   :read-only t))

(defun org-mcp-disable ()
  "Disable the org-mcp server."
  (mcp-server-lib-unregister-tool "org-get-todo-config"))

(provide 'org-mcp)
